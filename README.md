# `$ share-term` [![Donate now][donate-now]][paypal-donations]

Share the terminal with your friends.

It's possible to share it into another terminal or in a browser, both with request
control feature.

If you enjoy using *Share Term*, [supporting it](http://share-term.me/support)
would be really appreciated. :smile: :heart:

## Installation

You can install the package globally and use it as command line tool:

```sh
$ npm i -g share-term
```

Then, run `share-term --help` and see what the CLI tool can do.

```sh
$ share-term --help
share-term --help
Share the terminal with your friends.

usage: share-term [action] [options]

actions:
  get <id> [--control]     Connect to a terminal session. If `--control`
                           options is passed, remote control will be
                           requested.
  welcome <host> <id>      This action is used internally when starting
                           the terminal sharing.

options:
  -v, --version            Displays version information.
  -h, --help               Displays this help.
  -c, --control            Used to request remote control when the client
                           is connecting from a terminal.

examples:
  share-term               # Starts a shared terminal session
  share-term get <id>      # Connects to the terminal session with id <id>
  share-term get <id> -c   # Connects and asks for remote control in the
                           # terminal session with id <id>

## Usage
### :earth_africa: Sharing the terminal
To share your terminal do:

```sh
$ share-term
```

You will get a session id which you will send to your friends.

### :tokyo_tower: Accessing a session
To join a terminal session, having the id `<id>` you have two ways:

 1. Open the [Share Term website](http://share-term.me/) and enter your id there.
    Then click the <kbd>Access</kbd> button. To request remote control click the
    <kbd>ðŸ—¼</kbd> button in the right bottom side.
 2. Having `share-term` installed on your computer (see [Installation](#Installation))
    you can join the session using:

    ```sh
    # Without remote control
    $ share-term get <id>
    # With remote control
    $ share-term get <id> -c
    ```
