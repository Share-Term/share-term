# `$ share-term`
Share the terminal with your friends.

It's possible to share it into another terminal or in a browser, both with request
control feature.

If you enjoy using *Share Term*, [supporting it](http://share-term.me/support)
would be really appreciated. :smile: :heart:

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g share-term
```

For the help content, run:

```sh
$ share-term -h
```

## Usage
### :earth_africa: Sharing the terminal
To share your terminal do:

```sh
$ share-term
```

You will get a session id which you will send to your friends.

### :tokyo_tower: Accessing a session
To join a terminal session, having the id `<id>` you have two ways:

 1. Open the [Share Term website](http://share-term.me/) and enter your id there.
    Then click the <kbd>Access</kbd> button. To request remote control click the
    <kbd>ðŸ—¼</kbd> button in the right bottom side.
 2. Having `share-term` installed on your computer (see [Installation](#Installation))
    you can join the session using:
    ```sh
    # Without remote control
    $ share-term get <id>
    # With remote control
    $ share-term get <id> -c
    ```
